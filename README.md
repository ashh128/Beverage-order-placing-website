# Beverage-order-placing-website
1st year Web dvelopment project to place a beverage order
Developed a beverage ordering website that allows users to fully customize their orders based on personal preferences. The interface dynamically hides or displays options depending on the user's selections and adjusts the price in real-time. The ingredient list is read from a JSON file to ensure accurate customization options. Users can save their favorite orders to local storage, enabling quick reordering with a single click, enhancing user convenience and personalization.
